    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>-Smigo is a garden planner for vegetables and flowers. It will give you advice about companion planting and crop rotation.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>-First you need to signup and login. Click on a species on the left menu and then somewhere in the grid. Now you have added your first plant. Add more species and items so your grid equals your garden.</p>

    <h3>How do I delete a plant?</h3>
    <p>-Hold shift and click square or select the delete plant and click the square.</p>

    <h3>Is it for free?</h3>
    <p>-Yes it is. And tell all your friends about it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Firefox does not display a grid. This is because background-attachment can not be set to scroll in FF.</li>
        <li>Adding several years without adding plants results in no grid.</li>
    </ul>
